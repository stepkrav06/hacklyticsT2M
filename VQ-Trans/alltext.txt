Trochanteric bursitis is inflammation (swelling) of the bursa (fluid-filled sac near a joint) at the
outside (lateral) point of the hip known as the greater trochanter. When this bursa becomes
irritated or inflamed, it causes pain in the hip. Some of the common causes are: an injury such
as falling on the side of your hip, an overuse injury, and/ or incorrect posture. You may feel
soreness when you press on the outside of your hip or lie on that side. The pain will often get
worse with activities such as walking or climbing stairs. Pain can also spread, or radiate, down
your thigh.
The goals of the below exercises are to maximize range of motion and flexibility and work to
increase the strength and control of your hips/ core. Although some soreness with exercise is
expected, we do not want any sharp pain–pain that gets worse with each rep of an exercise or
any increased soreness for more than 24 hours. If this is the case, modify the exercises to
decrease the number of reps or the frequency.

HIP OSTEOARTHRITIS
Home Exercises
Osteoarthritis, commonly known as wear-and-tear arthritis, is a condition in which the natural
cushioning between joints (cartilage) wears away. When this happens, the bones of the joints
rub more closely against one another with less of the shock-absorbing benefits of cartilage.
The rubbing results in pain, swelling, stiffness, decreased ability to move and, sometimes, the
formation of bone spurs. The most common symptom of hip OA is pain around the hip joint
(generally located in the groin area). Most of the time, the pain develops slowly and worsens
over time.
The goals of the below exercises are to maximize range of motion and flexibility and work to
increase the strength and control of your hips/ core. Although some soreness with exercise is
expected, we do not want any sharp pain–pain that gets worse with each rep of an exercise or

ANTERIOR KNEE PAIN
Home Exercises
Anterior knee pain is pain that occurs at the front and center of the knee. It can be caused by
many different problems, including:
• Weak or overused muscles
• Chondromalacia of the patella (softening and breakdown of the cartilage
on the underside of the kneecap)
• Inflammations and tendon injury (bursitis, tendonitis)
• Loose ligaments with instability of the kneecap
• Articular cartilage damage (chondromalacia patella)
• Swelling due to fluid buildup in the knee joint
• An overload of the extensor mechanism of the knee with or without malalignment
of the patella
You may feel pain after exercising or when you sit too long. The pain may be a nagging ache or
an occasional sharp twinge. Because the pain is around the front of your knee, treatment has
traditionally focused on the knee itself and may include taping or bracing the kneecap, or patel-
la, and/ or strengthening the thigh muscle—the quadriceps—that helps control your kneecap to
improve the contact area between the kneecap and the thigh bone, or femur, beneath it. Howev-
er, recent evidence suggests that strengthening your hip and core muscles can also help.
The control of your knee from side to side comes from the glutes and core control; that is why
those areas are so important in management of anterior knee pain. The exercises below will
work on a combination of flexibility and strength of your knee, hip, and core. Although some
soreness with exercise is expected, we do not want any sharp pain–pain that gets worse with
each rep of an exercise or any increased soreness for more than 24 hours. If this is the case,
modify the exercises to decrease the number of reps or the frequency.

ANTERIOR CRUCIATE
LIGAMENT (ACL)
Home Exercises
An ACL injury is a tear or sprain of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), one of the major
ligaments in your knee. ACL injuries most commonly occur during sports that involve sudden
stops or changes in direction, jumping, and landing such as soccer, basketball, football, and
downhill skiing. Many people hear or feel a “pop” in the knee when an ACL injury occurs.
Your knee may swell, feel unstable, and become too painful to bear weight. The ACL provides
stability to the knee joint, as it prevents forward movement of the tibia (lower leg), as well as
helping provide rotational stability.
The goals of treatment for an ACL injury include relief of pain and inflammation (in the early
stages, ice can be helpful but make sure not to leave it on for more than 20 minutes), reduction
of stiffness and improvement or preservation of range of motion, and improvement in or
maintenance of mobility and function. The below exercises are to maximize range of motion
and flexibility and work to increase the strength and control of your knee/ hips/ core. And if
surgery is required, these will help to maximize your mobility beforehand and improve your
outcome after surgery. Although some soreness with exercise is expected, we do not want any
sharp pain, pain that gets worse with each rep of an exercise, or any increased soreness for
more than 24 hours. If this is the case, modify the exercises to decrease the number of reps

PATELLAR INSTABILITY
Home Exercises
When the knee bends, the patella slides evenly up and down within a groove at the end of the
femur. In some people, the patella is pulled out of the groove towards the outside of the knee
causing patella instability. Most commonly, this tracking problem causes discomfort with activity,
and pain around the sides of the kneecap.
Causes of patellar instability include a traumatic dislocation, such as occurs during a sports
activity, or a displacement caused by daily activities. Patellar instability may result from a
combination of different variables including bone structure, poor movement patterns, soft
tissue dysfunction, and muscle weakness. The muscles surrounding the hip and knee need to
be strong to help control the position of the leg and keep the kneecap stable. Addressing range
of motion and strength deficits while managing pain can help you safely transition back into
your normal activities.

MEDIAL COLLATERAL
LIGAMENT (MCL)
Home Exercises
A medial collateral ligament, or MCL injury, is a tear or sprain of one of the major ligaments of
your knee. The MCL is located along the inside of the knee joint, which prevents excessive side
movement of the knee. MCL injuries most commonly occur from direct-force trauma to the
outside of the knee, or putting pressure on the inside of the knee, causing the MCL to stretch
and/ or tear. The symptoms of an MCL injury are similar to other ligament injuries. You may
experience pain/ tenderness along the inside of the knee, along with swelling. Some people
also describe a feeling of instability of the knee when walking, as if the knee may give out, lock,
or catch. Your knee may feel stiff and be swollen. Many people hear or feel a “pop” in the knee
when the original injury occurs.
The goals of treating an MCL injury include relief of pain and inflammation, reduction of stiffness
and improvement/ preservation of range of motion, and improvement/ maintenance of
mobility and function. In early stages, icing the knee and elevation of the lower limb can be
helpful, but no longer than 20 minutes at a time is recommended. The below exercises are to
maximize range of motion/ flexibility, while also increasing strength/ control of the knee, hips,
and core. If surgery is required, these exercises will help improve your outcome after surgery.
Although some soreness is to be expected following these exercises, we do not want any sharp
pain, pain that gets worse with each repetition, or any increased soreness for more than 24
hours. If this is the case, we ask that you modify the exercise – try decreasing the number of
repetitions or the frequency.

POSTERIOR CRUCIATE
LIGAMENT (PCL)
Home Exercises
A posterior cruciate ligament, or PCL injury, is a tear or sprain of one of the major ligaments of
your knee. The PCL connects the thigh bone (femur) to your shin bone (tibia) and it prevents
your shin bone from slipping too far back in relation to your thigh bone. PCL tears make up less
than 20% of injuries to knee ligaments and oftentimes there is also damage to surrounding
ligaments or cartilage in the knee. PCL injuries most commonly occur from striking the knee
against the dashboard during an automobile accident, a sport related injury, or falling on the
knee while it’s bent. The symptoms of a PCL injury are similar to other ligament injuries. You
may experience pain/ tenderness or swelling behind the knee, especially when you kneel. Some
people also describe a feeling of instability of the knee when walking, as if the knee may give out,
lock, or catch. Your knee may feel stiff and be swollen. Another symptom possibly appearing two
weeks after the original injury, is pain in front of the knee when attempting to run or slow down.
Many people hear or feel a “pop” in the knee when the original injury occurs.
The goals of treating a PCL injury include relief of pain and inflammation, reduction of stiffness
and improvement/ preservation of range of motion, and improvement/ maintenance of
mobility and function. In early stages, icing the knee and elevation of the lower limb can be
helpful, but no longer than 20 minutes at a time is recommended. The below exercises are to

NON-SPECIFIC
CERVICAL PAIN
Home Exercises
Pain in the cervical spine can have many origins. There are multiple pain generators in our
spine. Orthopedic surgeons and rehabilitation specialist use a systematic approach to
differentiate the origin of cervical symptoms. Non-specific cervical pain refers to pain that
is localized to the cervical region, which does not travels up into the head or down into the
upper extremities. Some headaches do have their origins though in the cervical spine.
Often non-specific cervical pain can be a result of poor posture, muscular spasms and
tightness or overuse/fatigue. On average the head weight 10-12 lbs and its movement and
stability are controlled by the of the cervical vertebra /ligaments and muscular action. Any
stiffness, tightness or spasm of these multiple muscle groups can result in pain. Poor posture
results in muscle fatigue, tightness and imbalance. Consult with your orthopedist or physical
therapist of you are experiencing any cervical pain that will not resolve on its own.

SCIATICA
Home Exercises
Sciatica is a specific type of low back pain; it refers to altered sensation that normally radiates
from the low back into the buttocks, hip, and then down the leg into the foot. This can occur in
either or both lower extremities. Symptoms usually include pain, numbness, burning and/ or
tingling. Sciatica is often a result of injury to a muscle, ligament, bulging/ ruptured disk,
or arthritis.
While treating sciatica, one should work on:
• Avoiding positions/ activities that exacerbate pain
• Maintaining proper posture
• Using proper lifting techniques
• Avoiding prolonged sitting or standing
• Performing exercises that increase sciatic nerve and hamstring length
• Performing exercises to increase core strength and add stability to spine

SPINAL STENOSIS
Home Exercises
Spinal stenosis occurs when the spinal canal narrows and leads to increased pressure on the
spinal cord and/ or contact with the nerve roots. Spinal stenosis leads to pain in the lower back,
buttock, lower extremities, and feet, which can decrease daily function. Typically, pain will
increase when going from sitting to standing, walking, and performing back extension as well
as waking in the morning. You can have one or several of these symptoms with spinal stenosis.
There is a correlation between aging and spinal stenosis. 95% of the population over 50 years
old has some degree of spinal stenosis.
Exercise is critical to increase function and to decrease low back pain, as well as the radicular
symptoms that it causes. Typically, flexion exercises lead to decreased pain by opening up the
spinal canal, decreasing pressure and contact with nerve roots. Flexion of the low back is any e
xercise in which you are bending forward, such as sitting in a chair and touching the floor.
Physical therapy will teach core strengthening, lower extremity stretching, and strengthening
to increase tolerance to activities that may lead to pain and radicular symptoms.
As with all exercises, some soreness is expected. The exercises attached are general guidelines
and not meant to be an exhaustive list. Please use your best judgment when starting a home
exercise program. If you experience increased pain that continues without any decrease in
symptoms, please contact your MD or PT for guidance.

CERVICAL STENOSIS
Home Exercises
Cervical stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal or intervertebral foramen where each spinal
nerve root exits the spinal cord. It commonly occurs due to wear and tear from daily activities or
the progression of osteoarthritis. It can also occur due to trauma or congenital disease. Many
individuals have minimal symptoms but others with progressive symptoms can include pain,
numbness or tingling in upper or lower extremities, muscle weakness, difficulty with walking,
balance and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Symptoms can be progressive, thus worsen
over time.
Treatment can be very effective. This can include physical therapy, medication, and injections.
If an individual begin to develop muscle weakness or difficulty with walking or balance, surgical
intervention may be necessary. It is important to get an accurate and early diagnosis to prevent
progression of cervical spinal stenosis. If you are experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned
above, contact your Orthopedic Associates of Hartford physician or physical therapist for
a consult.

LOW BACK
Home Exercises
Low Back Pain
Low back pain is extremely common; almost everybody will experience some sort of low back
pain throughout their lives. Low back pain is often a result of injury to a muscle, ligament,
bulging/ ruptured disk, or arthritis. Symptoms are primarily in the low back, but can spread
into the lower extremities depending on severity and location of injury. Common causes
include improper lifting form, poor posture, lack of exercise, and natural degeneration.
Exercise is a great way to relieve low back pain and restore motion. Strengthening the low back
and core are also effective ways to decrease low back pain and prevent future occurrences.
Below are some exercises that should help to relieve and manage your low back pain.

McKENZIE EXTENSION
PROGRAM
Home Exercises
Low back pain affects nearly everyone at some stage of active adult life and is one of the most
common ailments. It is often described as fibrositis, slipped disk, lumbago, arthritis in the back,
or rheumatism and, when it causes pain extending into the leg, sciatica.
Pain can arise in the low back from prolonged overstretching of the ligaments in this area. Pain
produced by overstretching in this manner is common and arises particularly when we develop
poor postural habits. Whenever we remain in a relaxed position, whether standing, sitting, or
lying, prolonged overstretching can easily occur.
The most common cause of low back pain is postural stress. This type of low back pain is
frequently brought on by sitting for a long time in a poor position, prolonged forward bending
in bad working positions, awkward or heavy lifting, or standing and lying for a long time in a
poor position. In these positions, you will typically find that the low back is rounded.
LYING FACE DOWN
Lie face down with your arms beside your body and your head
turned to one side.
Staying in this position, take a few deep breaths, and then relax
completely for two or three minutes. Make a conscious effort
to remove all tension from the muscles in your low back, hips,
and legs. Without this complete relaxation, there is no chance of
eliminating any distortion that may be present in the joint.
LYING FACE DOWN IN EXTENSION
Remain lying down.
Place your elbows under your shoulders so that you lean on
your forearms. During this exercise, as with Exercise 1,
commence by taking a few deep breaths and then allow the
muscles in the low back, hips, and legs to relax completely.
Remain in this position for two to three minutes.
2
EXTENSION IN LYING
Remain lying face down, and then place your hands under your
shoulders in the press-up position.
As you straighten your elbows, push the top half of your body
up as far as pain permits. It is important that you completely
relax the pelvis, hips, and legs as you do this, and remember to
keep breathing normally.
Keep your pelvis, hips, and legs hanging limp and allow your low
back to sag.
Maintain this position for a second or two, then lower yourself
to the starting position.
Repeat this movement cycle in a smooth rhythmical motion,
extending your back as much as possible.
Repeat this exercise 10 times per session, and evenly spread six
to eight sessions throughout your day.
EXTENSION IN STANDING
Stand upright with your feet slightly apart, then place your
hands in the small of your back with the fingertips pointing
backward so that they meet in the center of your spine.
Bend your trunk backward at the waist as far as you can, using
your hands as a pivot point. It is important that you keep the
knees straight as you do this.
Maintain this position for a second or two, then return to the
starting position. Repeat this movement cycle, trying to bend
backward a little further each time.

HOW TO KNOW IF YOU ARE EXERCISING CORRECTLY:
You are exercising correctly and in the right direction when:
• Pain centralizes (moves from your leg, buttock, or side
toward the middle of your low back)
• Pain intensity gradually decreases
• Your range of movement increases
You are exercising incorrectly and in the wrong direction when:
• Pain moves away from the spine
• Pain intensity increases and remains worse
• Your range of motion decreases

ACHILLES TENDINITIS
Home Exercises
Achilles tendinitis is a common condition that occurs when the large tendon that runs down the
back of your lower leg becomes irritated and inflamed. The Achilles tendon connects your calf
muscles to your heel bone and is used when you walk, run, climb stairs, jump, and stand on your
tip toes. Although the Achilles tendon can withstand great stresses from running and jumping, it
is also prone to tendinitis, a condition associated with overuse and degeneration resulting in the
inflammation of the Achilles tendon.
Normal foot and ankle anatomy
Achilles tendinitis pain can occur within the tendon itself or at the point where it attaches to the
heel bone, called the Achilles tendon insertion.
Causes
Achilles tendinitis is typically not related to a specific injury. The problem results from repetitive
stress to the tendon. This often happens when we push our bodies to do too much, too soon,
but other factors can make it more likely to develop tendinitis, including:
• Sudden increase in the amount or intensity of exercise activity—for example, increasing
the distance you run every day by a few miles without giving your body a chance to
adjust to the new distance
• Tight calf muscles—Having tight calf muscles and suddenly starting an aggressive
exercise program can put extra stress on the Achilles tendon
• Bone spur—Extra bone growth where the Achilles tendon attaches to the heel bone
can rub against the tendon and cause pain
Symptoms
Common symptoms of Achilles tendinitis include:
• Pain and stiffness along the Achilles tendon in the morning
• Pain along the tendon or back of the heel that worsens with activity
• Severe pain the day after exercising
• Thickening of the tendon
• Bone spur (insertional tendinitis)
• Swelling that is present all the time and gets worse throughout the day with activity

POSTERIOR TIBIALIS
TENDONITIS
Home Exercises
The posterior tibialis tendon is a major stabilizing tendon located along the inside of the ankle
joint. The tendon is an extension of a muscle that runs along the inside of the shin bone named
posterior tibialis muscle. This muscle is responsible for providing ankle control and stability to
the medial or inside of the ankle joint. This is a tendon that is commonly injured, particularly in
individuals who present with pes planus, commonly known as flat foot.
This posterior tibialis tendon is commonly irritated with overuse or training errors with activities
including prolonged standing, walking or running. Another cause is poorly supportive footwear.
This can be a progressive disorder as the tendon can become progressively lengthened from
stress making it ineffective or result in tendon rupture. Effective treatment requires early
intervention with R.I.C.E (Rest, ice, compression and elevation) use of properly fitted, supportive
footwear, exercises to promote proper flexibility and strength and orthotic intervention for
individuals with flat feet resulting in over-pronation. Consult with an orthopedist or physical
therapist to discuss the most effective treatment for your stage of injury.

ANKLE SPRAIN
Home Exercises
An ankle sprain occurs when the strong ligaments that support the ankle stretch beyond their
limits and tear. Ankle sprains are common injuries that occur among people of all ages. They range
from mild to severe, depending on how much damage there is to the ligament(s). Most sprains are
minor injuries that heal with home treatments, like rest and applying ice. However, if your ankle is
very swollen and painful to walk on, or if you are having trouble putting weight on your ankle at all,
be sure to see your doctor. Without proper treatment and rehabilitation, a more severe sprain can
weaken your ankle—making it more likely that you will injure it again. Repeated ankle sprains can
lead to long-term problems, including chronic ankle pain, arthritis, and ongoing instability.
Normal anatomy of the foot and ankle
An ankle sprain is an injury to one or more of the ligaments that stabilize the ankle. A twisting force
to the lower leg or foot can cause a sprain. The lateral ligaments on the outside of the
ankle are injured most frequently.
Description
Ligaments are strong, fibrous tissues that connect bones to other bones. The ligaments in the ankle
help to keep the bones in proper position and stabilize the joint. Sprains can range from tiny tears in
the fibers that make up the ligament to complete tears through the tissue. If there is a complete tear
of the ligament, the ankle may become unstable after the initial injury phase passes. Over time, this
instability can result in damage to the bones and cartilage of the ankle joint.
Symptoms
A sprained ankle is painful. Other symptoms may include:
• Swelling
• Bruising
• Tenderness to touch
• Instability of the ankle—this may occur when there has been complete tearing of the ligament or a
complete dislocation of the ankle joint

Home Exercises

Shoulder “irritability” is defined by when and how painful your shoulder is during motion.
Consider how irritable your shoulder is feeling to guide how “hard” you push into the stretching.
• High level of irritability is when pain is experienced at rest or prior to the end of your
available range
• Moderate level of irritability is when pain is experienced at the end of available range
• Low level of irritability is when there is just discomfort into the end of available range
If your shoulder is highly irritable, gentle stretching and range of motion is required to not
worsen your symptoms.
If your shoulder is moderately irritable, try to push into end range, but if there is an increase in
discomfort that doesn’t go away by the last repetition or that elevated level of pain lasts beyond
the exercise, go easier next session.
If your shoulder is at a low level of irritability, try to push into your “end range” of motion, still
listening to your shoulder, without causing an increase in your level of pain.

Begin by correcting your low back so that it is not slouched. This
will correct much of the spine. You may also need to perform a
small chin tuck as well. Pull your shoulder blades down and back
The image on the right shows how you should position your

Shoulder Dysfunction
Anterior tightness and periscapular weakness can be contributing factors to shoulder pain and
dysfunction. Periscapular weakness occurs when the muscles that attach to the shoulder blade
fail to provide adequate support for the shoulder complex as a whole. Loss of balance between
flexibility and strength can lead to scapular dyskinesia. Scapular dyskinesia is recognized as an
alteration of normal shoulder movement.
How does shoulder dysfunction occur? Anterior tightness, periscapular weakness, and scapular
dyskinesia can be the result of trauma, repetitive use, and/ or poor posture. Much of life
happens in front of us. Computers, phones, cooking, and sitting subject us to more of a
forward flexed posture. If trauma occurs, our immediate response is to protect our shoulders
by posturing in a forward flexed position. Over time, this position contributes to shortening of
the chest muscles and lengthening and weakening of the back muscles. Ultimately, this also
leads to decreased spacing at the anterior shoulder joint where the rotator cuff muscles can
then be irritated, frayed, or even torn.
The goal of therapy is to restore normal movement of the shoulder through strengthening,
stretching, and postural correction.

SPLINTING
Wear a wrist splint at night consistently for one month.
If symptoms of numbness subside, then you can try leaving it off
for a few nights. If numbness returns, resume wearing it until
you follow up with your physician. Daytime use of the splint is
sometimes helpful for activities that aggravate your symptoms.
USING YOUR HAND
Avoid sustained grip, repetitive use and vibration. When using
your hand, keep the wrist in a neutral position.

1. Make a fist
4. Stretch thumb out
towards you
2. Straighten fingers
5. Rotate arm so palm
facing away from you
3. Tilt wrist back
6. Gently pull thumb
• Do 3x/day
• Hold each move 3 seconds
• Do 5-10 sets
• Stop any stretch short of causing increased symptoms
STRENGTHENING
It is common to feel weak in grip and pinch. When you are having carpal tunnel symptoms, do
not try to strengthen by squeezing a ball or putty. Wait at least one month with no numbness.
When you begin, go slowly. It is much easier to add more repetitions the next day then to
recover after flaring up the nerve again.
1oahct.com
Avoiding repetitive use and stress to your wrist and thumb are key to decreasing your pain.
MEDICATIONS:
Only take oral anti-inflammatory medications if directed by your provider.
Your provider may determine if a cortisone injection would be helpful. You may experience a
temporary increase in discomfort following an injection but in a few days you should feel better.
There is no need to wear a splint following the cortisone injection. You can increase your activity
level carefully.
SPLINTING:
Your provider or therapist may fit you with a splint.
It will immobilize both your wrist and thumb.
Initially wear the splint day and night for two weeks, removing
only for washing/bathing. You may then slowly decrease how
much you use it. Be aware of what activities tend to aggravate
the hand and wearthe splint at those times.
ICING:
For pain relief, apply an ice pack to the painful area for 15 minutes. A bag of frozen peas works
well as an ice pack. You may do this as often as needed during the day.

TAPING:
Specialized taping is often beneficial to support the area and decrease pain. The brands of tape
that we recommend are RockTape, KT Tape, or Kinesio Tec Tape and are readily found in your
pharmacy or online. The taping technique our therapists use is pictured below. There are
instructional videos you may access on YouTube by typing in “Taping for DeQuervain’s Tenosynovitis”.
Try several different ways to see what works best for you. The color of tape does not matter.
USING YOUR HAND:
Avoid repetitive wrist or thumb movements. Think about your hobbies: instruments, gardening,
gaming and how they may be affecting your hand pain. If it is the hand you use on a computer
mouse, consider changing the sensitivity of the mouse in the control settings or using it with
your other hand.
If you recently had a baby, support the baby’s head on a pillow when feeding and avoid picking
the baby up under the arms. Try scooping them up by lifting under their bottom.

CUBITAL TUNNEL
Home Exercises
The key to managing numbness and tingling in the ring and little fingers is to prevent a sustained
elbow bent position or pressure on the inside of the elbow.
SPLINTING
At nighttime, wrap a towel roll around your elbow and secure
with tape. This should allow you a small amount of motion in
your elbow yet keep it from staying in a bent position. If it tends
to slip, wear a light long sleeve shirt and safety pin to shirt.
Your provider may have given you a rigid night time splint
similar to the one pictured to the right. Wear during sleeping
hours unless instructed otherwise.
Using an elbow pad is also helpful. Your physician may give you
one or you can order online. Search for “Heelbo pad”. These
tend to run small. Most adults will need XL to XXL. We do not
recommend wearing a tight compressive sleeve on your elbow
at this time.
